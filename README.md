This is the quote of the day website, the attached youtube video explains it all.


To begin with, save the folder on an acessible place, then use command prompt to navigate to the "web_devproj" file, then type "node server.js"

Then go into a chronium browser, and type "localhost" to open the web page. Follow instructions in the video, and register for a new account & log in afterwards. 


If you would like to acess this website API/backend through insomnia, you can register a new account, collect the provided api key and date. 

In insomnia, you create a new post request with json as the body, then in the top bar where it says "post", enter "localhost/quotesapi"

Have fun and happy Quoting!
